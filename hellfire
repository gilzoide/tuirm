Welcome to tuirm's hell build script
====================================

The build output is the "build/" directory.
This package provides shared libraries for tuirm, and will eventually have
some usage examples. Call with `debug=1` for a debug build.

Targets:
- `hell docs` will create the Doxygen html and man documentation
- `hell run` will run the test application

For more information, read the "*.md" files, as they explain plenty stuff.]]
